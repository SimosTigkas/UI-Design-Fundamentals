Typography

Good typography requires the understanding of other fundamentals, 
along with a few special considerations like the following:

1) Font choice(s) (not more than 2)
2) Visual Hierarchy
3) Font size (scale)
4) Alignment
5) Letter spacing & line height
6) Font styles (weight, italics, etc..)
7) Color & Contrast
